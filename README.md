# US Stock Value Forecasting with Technical Indicators

This work analyzes the use of technical indicators to predict stock prices for computer hardware companies listed on the New York Stock Market, aiming to verify how close the predicted values are to U.S. stock prices. By employing the LSTM machine learning technique, and ARIMA as a statistical model, and using technical indicators such as CCI (Commodity Channel Index), RSI (Relative Strength Index) MACD (Moving Average Convergence/Divergence), Parabolic SAR and Bollinger Bands, the analysis seeks to evaluate the effectiveness of these tools to predict future stock prices. The results of three different company data sets (NVIDIA, AMD and INTEL) with data from the last 5 years show that some technical indicators can significantly improve the prediction of future stock prices and assist in future investment plans.
